        <h3>Summer 2024 Orientation Day</h3>
        <h2><u class="underline">Introduction</u></h2>
        <p>
          Hi everyone! My name is Thanush, and I am currently pursuing a
          Bachelor of Computing in Computer Science (co-op) at the University
          of Guelph. I have completed two years of my studies and am now
          finishing my first co-op work term. During this term, I worked at
          CIBC (Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce) as a Technical Systems
          Analyst with the Market Data Support team at CIBC Capital Markets.
          <br /><br />
          At CIBC, I gained valuable experience by working on a range of
          impactful projects with the support of a dedicated team. Throughout
          this report, I will share my experiences at the bank and how this
          opportunity has positively influenced my career growth.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2><u class="underline">Information About The Employer</u></h2>
        <p>
          CIBC is widely known as one of the top five banks in Canada. It serves
          over 14 million personal banking, business, public sector, and
          institutional clients in Canada, the U.S., and around the world. The
          office where I worked is located at 161 Bay Street on the 4th floor of
          the TD Canada Trust Tower. Many of CIBC's offices, including the trade
          floor, occupy several floors in this building. The areas of computer
          science most relevant to my role at CIBC include IT troubleshooting
          and software development.

          Interesting Facts
          <ul>
            <li>
              There were over 500 summer interns this work term, the most amount
              of interns the company has ever had at once.
            </li>
            <li>
              CIBC operates out of three main locations in downtown Toronto: its
              headquarters at 81 Bay Street, known as CIBC Square; 161 Bay
              Street, also known as the TD Canada Trust Tower, which includes
              the trade floor; and 595 Bay Street, referred to as Atrium on Bay.
            </li>
            <li>
              The company was founded in 1867 and has since grown to become one
              of the biggest and best banks in the country.

        <h2><u class="underline">Learning Goals</u></h2>
        <p>My 5 goals were...</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            To be able to engage in hands-on projects and challenges with the
            team
          </li>
          <li>
            Enhance my problem-solving skills to efficiently and effectively
            address a wide range of user problems
          </li>
          <li>
            Gain a better understanding of the trading softwares used within my
            LOB (line of business)
          </li>
          <li>Make meaningful and valuable connections</li>
          <li>Learn more about market data</li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <p>
          I set a few goals related to my job tasks, knowing they were areas I
          wanted to improve. For example, before starting this role, I had
          little to no knowledge of market data—it was a topic I wasn’t familiar
          with. However, working with the market data team gave me the chance to
          learn more about it. I was also eager to pick up any technical skills
          related to computer science. Since this was my first work term, I
          wasn’t focused on specific skills; I was open to learning anything
          that would help me grow. I wanted exposure to coding languages and
          technologies related to IT troubleshooting because they were relevant
          to my role and would help me excel further. Now, after four months, I
          can confidently say I’ve made progress on all my goals. Some were
          accomplished more than others, but I believe I made meaningful
          improvements across the board. My goals have not only allowed me to
          improve my skills as a student, but also as a person.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2><u class="underline">Job Description And Projects</u></h2>
        <p>
          My role during this co-op involved a variety of tasks. Early on, I
          helped onboard summer students within Capital Markets by installing
          trading software applications, such as Bloomberg, on their machines.
          With over 150 students joining, it was a large project with a tight
          deadline. I had to quickly pick up skills on the job, including
          installing software as an administrator, navigating user computers,
          and troubleshooting any issues that came up. <br /><br />
          Aside from that, my work varied day to day. Our team managed a
          helpdesk number for users on the trade floor, who would call if they
          had issues with trading software. For example, if a user couldn’t pull
          data from Bloomberg into Excel, I would troubleshoot by connecting to
          their machine to resolve the issue. I also had the opportunity to work
          on a coding project assigned by my manager, Matthew Cheung. The
          project involved using the Bloomberg B-pipe API (blpapi) to request
          and retrieve real-time data on various currencies. This was a Java
          project, and I applied many of the skills I learned in school, such as
          API requests, coding in Java, and testing and debugging my code.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The most interesting and unique part of my job is interacting with users on the trade floor every day. \
            I really enjoy helping others solve problems, especially when they get stuck on technical issues. By fixing these problems quickly, I can make a big difference in their workflow. 
            When I help them get back to work faster, it improves their productivity and makes their job easier. It feels rewarding to know that my support has a direct impact on their day-to-day tasks. 
            Plus, solving these issues helps me build better technical skills and stronger relationships with the people I help.</p>

        <h2><u class="underline">Conclusion</u></h2>
        <p>
          Overall, this co-op experience has been a pivotal stepping stone in my
          career development. It has given me a firsthand look at what it's like
          to work in the computer science field and explore the various
          opportunities it offers. I've also gained insight into the many career
          paths available within Computer Science. Through this experience,
          I’ve learned how to collaborate effectively with a team and perform
          under pressure. I’ve also acquired several technical skills, including
          network and systems administration, which I believe will be valuable
          in my future career. I have had the opportunity to make meaningful
          connections with fellow co-ops and full-time employees across the
          bank, positively impacting my experience. As I move forward with the
          next four months as a Technical Systems Analyst on the Market Data
          Support team, I’m excited to continue growing and learning in this
          role.
