				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>Hi everyone! My name is Thanush and I am currently enrolled and completing a Bachelor of Computing in Computer Science (co-op) at the University Of Guelph. 
					As you are reading this I have completed 2 years in school and am about to complete my first co-op work term. 
					My first work term was spent at CIBC (Canadian Imperial Bank Of Commerce) as a Technical Systems Analyst with the Market Data Support team at CIBC Capital Markets.<br>
					<br>
					While working at CIBC, I had the opportunity to gain valuable experience by completing a variety of purposeful projects with the help of a supportive team. 
					Throughout this report, I will discuss my experience here at the bank and how this company has positively impacted my career. 
					</p>
					<br>

                <h2>
                    My Goals
                </h2>
				<p>My 5 goals were... 
                </p>
					<ol>
						<li>To be able to engage in hands-on projects and challenges with the team</li>
						<li>Enhance my problem-solving skills to efficiently and effectively address a wide range of user problems</li>
						<li>Gain a better understanding of the trading softwares used within my LOB (line of business) </li>
						<li>Make meaningful and valuable connections </li>
						<li>Learn more about market data </li>
					</ol>
                    <br>
				<p>
                    I developed a few of my goals relating to my job tasks as I knew they were things I wanted to work on. For example before starting this role I had little to none knowledge on market data, it was a topic that was unfamiliar with me. By working with the market data team I was able to learn more about market data. I wanted to learn any technical skills related to the field of computer science. As this was my first work term my mind wasn’t set on any particular skills, any skills would be beneficial towards my learning. Allowing me to experience all the skills this field has to offer. I wanted to work with any coding languages and technologies regarding IT troubleshooting. These were technologies I wanted to work with as they were relevant to my role and would allow me to further excel. After 4 long months have passed by, reflecting on my goals I set at the start of the summer, I thoroughly believe I was able to achieve all my goals. Some goals were accomplished more than others, although I was able to tackle each goal making significant progress and improvement. 
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Job Description And Projects
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An overview of my job consisted of many things. At the start of my co-op I had the opportunity to help with the onboarding of summer students within Capital Markets. This consisted of installing trading software applications onto users' machines, applications like Bloomberg. There were over 150 incoming summer students, a big project with a short deadline. This project consisted of skills I had to learn on the job, skills involving installing as administrator, navigating through user’s computers and troubleshooting any errors or issues. 
                    Other projects I got to work on varied from day to day, our team had a helpdesk number that users on the trade floor would be able to contact if an issue were to occur. Issues involving any of the trading softwares they use. For example, a user isn’t able to pull data from Bloomberg into excel. This would result in me troubleshooting and connecting to their machine in order to resolve the issue. 
                    I also had the opportunity to tackle a coding project provided by my manager Matthew Cheung. The project was to utilize the Bloomberg B-pipe API (blpapi) to request and pull real time data regarding different currencies. This project was coded in java, and involved many skills I learned during my time at school. Skills such as API requests, coding in java, and testing and debugging my code.

                    Conclusion
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Overall this co-op experience has been a pivotal stepping stone in my career development. It has allowed me to experience what working in the computer science field is like and what it has to offer. It has also opened my eyes to the many career paths within Computer Science.  I have learned what it’s like to work collaboratively with a team, and to be able to perform under pressure.  I have also learned many technical skills, including network and systems administrator skills. Skills that I believe will benefit me in the future. As I continue the next 4 months as a Technical Systems Analyst with the Market Data Support team, I am eager to continue to grow and learn within this role.
