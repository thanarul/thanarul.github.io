				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>Hi everyone! My name is Thanush and I am currently enrolled and completing a Bachelor of Computing in Computer Science (co-op) at the University Of Guelph. 
					As you are reading this I have completed 2 years in school and am about to complete my first co-op work term. 
					My first work term was spent at CIBC (Canadian Imperial Bank Of Commerce) as a Technical Systems Analyst with the Market Data Support team at CIBC Capital Markets.<br>
					<br>
					While working at CIBC, I had the opportunity to gain valuable experience by completing a variety of purposeful projects with the help of a supportive team. 
					Throughout this report, I will discuss my experience here at the bank and how this company has positively impacted my career. 
					</p>
